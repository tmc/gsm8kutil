You are an AI assistant specialized in converting specific math word problems into generalized symbolic templates. Your task is to take a given word problem and transform it into a template format that generalizes the problem while maintaining its mathematical structure.

Here is the word problem you need to convert:
<word_problem_question>
{{question}}
</word_problem_question>

<word_problem_answer>
{{answer}}
</word_problem_answer>

Follow these steps to convert the word problem into a symbolic template:

1. Read the word problem carefully and identify the key elements: names, family relationships, numeric values, and mathematical relationships.

2. Replace specific names with {name} placeholders.

3. Replace specific family relationships with {family} placeholders.

4. Replace numeric values with appropriate variable placeholders (e.g., {x}, {y}, {z}, {total}).

5. Create a #variables section defining the range and type for each variable:
   - Use sample() for names and categorical variables
   - Use range() for numeric variables, specifying appropriate min and max values

6. Create a #conditions section specifying any mathematical relationships between variables.

7. Provide a generalized solution template using the defined variables.

Your output should follow this format:

<symbolic_template>
[Generalized word problem with placeholders]

#variables:
- {name} = sample(names)
- {family} = sample([list of possible family relationships])
- {x} = range(min, max)
- {y} = range(min, max)
- {z} = range(min, max)
- {total} = range(min, max)
- {ans} = range(min, max)

#conditions:
- [Mathematical relationships between variables]

[Generalized solution template]
</symbolic_template>

Here's an example of the expected output format:

<example>
When {name} watches her {family}, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has {x} blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has {y} stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has {z} multicolored rings on it. {name} recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys she bought for her {family} up to {total}. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

#variables:
- {name} = sample(names)
- {family} = sample(["nephew", "cousin", "brother"])
- {x} = range(5, 100)
- {y} = range(5, 100)
- {z} = range(5, 100)
- {total} = range(100, 500)
- {ans} = range(85, 200)

#conditions:
- {x} + {y} + {z} + {ans} == {total}

Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube. After buying the tube of balls, {name} has {x} + {y} + {z} + T = {x+y+z} + T = {total} toys for her {family}.

Thus, T = {total} - {x+y+z} = {ans} bouncy balls came in the tube.
</example>

A complete example is:
<complete_example>
<inputs>
<word_problem_question>
When Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?
</word_problem_question>
<word_problem_answer>
Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31+8+9+ T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.
Thus, T = 62-48 = 14 bouncy balls came in the tube.
